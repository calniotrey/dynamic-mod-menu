Ever felt like your edicts list becomes cluttered by edicts whose sole purpose is to open the settings of a mod? Here is a lightweight weight and performance-friendly mod that can solve that issue!

[h1]For players[/h1]
This mod adds a button on the main menu (opened up by pressing escape) that opens the Mod Menu. You can then select the mod you want to access the settings of. Simple right?
The mods simply have to register themselves. If you don't see the mod you're looking for, you can [b]kindly[/b] ask its modder to come see this mod description, so they can see if they want to make their mod register itself.

Concerning the keyboard feature:
You can use SHIFT+A for an A. You can activate capslock with CTRL+C and spaces with CTRL+S. The majority of the special chars need a click (except for + and - with use the numpad + and -).

Place this mod below SWFR and any other mod altering interface/mainmenu_view.gui.
This mod changes checksum and has nearly no compatibility issues.
This mod alters interface/mainmenu_view.gui.
If you don't see the button on the "escape menu", another mod is altering that file. To solve it, you can simply place DMM below it (or at the bottom of the load order).
This mod is save game compatible.

[h1]For modders[/h1]
[h2]How to add a button for your mod in DMM[/h2]
This is really straightforward, so don't be afraid ;)
All the infos are [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2458024521/3077629031353110169/]here[/url].
I had to move them from this page to that discussion because steam limits the size of the workshop description.

[h2]Keyboard Feature[/h2]
This mod also adds a "keyboard" that allows the player to rename stuff. Simply use [code]dmm_keyboard_rename = TARGET = thing_to_rename }[/code] in the country scope of the player (you can use event targets for the TARGET).
Once the renaming is done, the on_action [code]dmm_keyboard_rename_finished (this = TARGET, from = player country that renamed)[/code] will be fired. If you use it, use a unique flag to make sure that it was your mod that required the rename and check the scope type before (`is_scope_type = leader` if checking for a leader flag).
See example add-on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2519537561]here[/url]
This feature was codeveloped with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053578024/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990]mr_trousers[/url] with some design advice from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/theminxlynx/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990]TheMinxLynx[/url].

[h1]Template for settings menu[/h1]
You probably know it, GUI modding in Stellaris is quite hard and annoying. But having a good looking event is really nice. So I created a template you can freely use and change!
Checkout [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2458024521/3131667021971880420/]this discussion[/url] for more info on it!

[h1]Credits[/h1]
Thanks to mr_trousers for the keyboard feature and to TheMinxLynx for design advice.

Thanks to OldEnt for making an example template.
Thanks to The Stellaris Modding Den.

[h1]Legal Stuff[/h1]
Do not copy any content from this mod without permission. This includes modpacking of course (instead do a steam collection and let your user merge locally).
You have my permission to use the template (event and gui code files having "template" in the name). Make sure to rename the elements if you change them. Please credit ;)
